Evaluation : 7/10

I have known about Zen long before, but never try to research seriously about it. I don't remember how and when I first known it, but to me, Zen was simply a technique for someone like monk ,hermit or priest who usually have a lot of spiritual activities in their lives. Zen would be one technique for them to escape from the material life, I thought.

However, if you do a search with the phrase 'Zen and Art', it turn out that there are now a lot of books with the title 'Zen and the art of ..'. (FYI : One of the best seller was Robert Pirsig’s 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'. I will try it later ). Intently or not, those articles are implying the strong relationship between Zen and Art. And, seem like Zen could be applied to many aspects of life.

Let's me untie a little bit about the hidden part of Zen.

Zen originated from India Buddhism, spread to China under the name of Chan, then was brung into Japan where it was varied to many types that we know today. Zen was defined based on the Buddhism, Zen Buddhism. However, Zen Buddhism is not a theory, an idea, or a piece of knowledge. It is not a belief, dogma, or religion; but rather, it is a practical experience, a way of vigilance and self-discovery. Usually it is practiced through a technique named Zazen (座禅 - za meaning sitting, and Zen meaning meditation in Japanese), quietly sit down, focus on your breath, let your thought melt away, fuse your self into the background. This is Zen.

In a sense, 'Art' is skill acquired by experience, study, or observation. (According to Merriam-Webster dictionary)

Interestingly, the sharing thing between Zen and Art is 'practicing'. Will we be in the state of Zen, if we keep on practicing any specific skill?

Following the story of Eugen,a professor in philosophy came from Germany but was living in Japan for six years, the process of practicing the skill of 'Archery' (or 'kyudo' in Japanese) to reach out the door of Zen was disclosed. From the beginning he had to learn how to hold the bow properly, how to draw the string back, hold the position of the arm the body, aim and make a shot. Seem easy, but it has a lot of difficult lessons to learn. For instance, the lesson of shooting the arrow purposeless. The author really spent year times in order to just learn how to shot. And what he got from the Master was :
>"The right shot at the right moment does not come because you do not let go of yourself. You do not wait for fulfillment, but brace yourself for failure.The right art is purposeless, aimless! The more obstinately you try to learn how to shoot the arrow for the sake of hitting the goal, the less you will succeed in the one and the further the other will recede. What stands in your way is that you have a much too willful will. You think that what you do not do yourself does not happen. You must learn to wait properly."

Here if we explain by a scientific and 'philosophical' way, it will be like this. When you pull the string the energy will be cumulated in the form of static energy. This energy would be stored as more as you maintain this position. Then, 'quantity' become 'quality', 'static energy' turn into 'dynamic energy' of the arrow. But when? The point is you have to forget the goal, do it purposeless, take a shot as naturally as the way you breath. So when you achieve that state, you would forget every thing, and the moment just come.

In the end, I would say what I take from here is a simple version of 'How to be Zen' : **practicing** and **purposeless**. How about you ?.
