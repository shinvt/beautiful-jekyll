This is my first post, how exciting! 
Fisrtly, guess what! Why I start a blog for my own?

Believe or not, it's a silly reason. I was failed in my relationship. Like any peoples out there, I depressed, stressed, hated every thing, lost goal... Stop that!!!. Instead of throwing a fuck to life, I chose writting as the way of easing my mind. 

That why I start, even thought I am not good at that.

Bear with me if you can !
